# Samtala

## Decentralized Communication Exploration

Samtala (Swedish for "discourse") is an exploratory project aimed at learning about and potentially developing a decentralized, peer-to-peer communication platform. This project is in its very early stages and serves primarily as a learning experience in distributed systems, the Zig programming language, and related technologies.

### Project Status: Early Exploration

üöß **This project is in the initial conceptual and learning phase. No functional code is available yet.** üöß

### Goals

1. Explore the implementation of a decentralized communication system
2. Learn and apply Zig programming for systems development
3. Experiment with distributed systems concepts
4. Investigate modern encryption and privacy-preserving technologies
5. Document the learning journey and challenges encountered

### Potential Features (Subject to Change)

- Peer-to-peer messaging
- End-to-end encryption
- Decentralized chat rooms
- User-controlled data storage
- Cross-platform support

### Technologies Under Consideration

- **Core Service**: Zig
- **User Interface**: Rust (tentative)
- **Networking**: Custom UDP protocol, WebRTC
- **Data Synchronization**: CRDTs, Viewstamped Replication
- **Discovery**: Distributed Hash Tables (DHT)

### Current Focus

The current focus is on research, learning, and initial design. No substantial code has been written yet.

### Contribution

While this is primarily a personal learning project, I'm open to discussions, suggestions, and knowledge sharing. Feel free to open issues for discussions or questions.

### Development Pace

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This is a side project developed in my spare time alongside full-time employment. Updates and progress may be infrequent and inconsistent.

### Follow the Journey

I'll be documenting my learning process and any progress through:

- Updates to this README
- [Blog posts](https://codingpaw.dev/tags/samtala/)
- Occasional code commits as the project progresses
